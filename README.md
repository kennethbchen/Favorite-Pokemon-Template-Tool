## What is this?
This is a (kind of janky) tool used to fill out this favorite Pokemon template:

(Not full size)
![Blank Template Preview](https://github.com/kennethbchen/Favorite-Pokemon-Template-Tool/blob/master/resources/template%20modified%20small.png)

## Usage


1. Click a cell on the grid to enter a selection menu for that cell. The available options for that cell will be displayed
2. Click on an image to select that Pokemon or click outside the menu's space to close the menu
3. Repeat around 194 times
4. Click on the "Generate" button at the bottom of the screen to generate the image which you can right click and save

- Duplicate Pokemon are either different forms, regional variants, or gender differences
- Some cells don't have any valid options (Gen 1 Dark types, Gen 7/8 Megas)
- Some cells only have one valid option

Currently, the bottom half of the template (black background) is not supported. You'll have to do that yourself with some image editing program.


## Notes

- The page won't display well on smaller screens. Try to maximize the browser window.
- Many, many images will be loaded (like 1,300+), so some probably won't display immediately.
- All Time Favorite (bottom right cell) will probably lag while it is loading all the images.
